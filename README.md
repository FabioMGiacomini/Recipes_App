# A Recipes App that works with NodeJS and MongoDB

## Description

<p>You can do any CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operation. The app follows the MVC schema to have a cleaner vision of everything.</p>

## How to start

The only thing you need is an account on MongoDB Atlas (it's free) and a username and password to start. To sign in go here https://account.mongodb.com/account/login

<h3>Create a database and a user to operate with it. </h3>
<p>Save the user name and password and the db name in your config.env file to import them in index.js</p>

There's no need to create a collection, the schema model creates that for you to avoid errors.

### Front Page

<p>The front end is rendered with the template engine EJS</p>

<p>The views folder contains pages and partials to create the site and to manage functions and parameters</p>
